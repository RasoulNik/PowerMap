## Welcome to GitHub Pages
We present a measurement-driven algorithm to map
the large-scale channel losses observed between a cellular base
station and any point in its coverage area. The algorithm
is on-line, meaning that it operates on continuously arriving
measurements. Its distinguishing features are the use of two
kernel functions, suitably chosen for the problem at hand, and
a simple technique to sparsify the dictionary of measurements
retained in memory. Evaluations in campus and urban settings
indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces, roughly in half,
the prediction error of existing single-kernel and multikernel
algorithms.
